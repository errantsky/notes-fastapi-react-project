# notes-fastapi-react-project

A few months ago I tried this project using Django-REST and React, writing a decent amount of the [frontend](https://github.com/errantsky/sibnotes_frontend) and a bit of the [backend](https://github.com/errantsky/sib_notes_django_rest), but abandoned it due to my research work. Now, I will be using FastAPI to complete this project.

Based on the [fastapi-react](https://github.com/Buuntu/fastapi-react#fixtures) template.
